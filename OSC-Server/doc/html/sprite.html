<h1 id="sprite">Sprite</h1>
<p>A sprite acts sorta like a single model. It uses a single vertex buffer object, element buffer object, shader program, and texture.</p>
<p>The Sprite class keeps track of things like the vbo name, shader program name, and texture name, as well as transformation information. </p>
<p>Functions are offered for modifying these values and doing special calculations</p>
<h3 id="void-update_stuff">void update_*(stuff)</h3>
<p>Calling any update function simply updates the sprite's value(s) to the given value(s).</p>
<h3 id="void-add_stuff">void add_*(stuff)</h3>
<p>Calling any add function adds the given values to the sprite's values. In hindsight this isn't so great because if a packet is dropped on one Pi, it goes out of sync.</p>
<h3 id="void-gradual_stuff-glfloat-time_sec">void gradual_*(stuff, GLfloat time_sec)</h3>
<p>Calling any gradual function gradually updates the sprite's value(s) to the given value(s) over a given period of time (in seconds).</p>
