Instructions for Pi setup

to change rotation (if needed):
	>sudo nano /boot/config.txt

	find display_rotate, change value to 3:
	display_rotate = 3

	^X
	Y
	M-D
	enter

	>sudo reboot

installing libraries for this:

	>sudo apt-get install libtiff5-dev libpng12-dev libjpeg8-dev libyaml-cpp-dev

	for wosclib stuff, download from their sourceforge page and unpack
	configure it on the pi:

	>./configure
	>make

	when that's done, it generates a libwosclib.a file.
	move this file to /usr/lib

That's it!
